For setup in ts 
1 add env file for ur link  and also for port so it know where it connects 
these are ignored by me so add them yourself or intiliaze them 
node_modules
.env
dist

Database choice : My choice in db was a nosql mongoose aplication beacuse ease of use connection and structure of nosql ever since the introduction of nosql has it become my choice as default so thats the reason  i choose it . 

im not using any special packages over what was required express node and typescript i use thunderclient as my choice of testing api i used postman but ease of acess lead me too keep using thunderclient.

the way the application works is we have 2 colums tasks and users  we have crude operation so u can create read update delete for both of them and they intereact realtivly well there is some  error handling too make sure not wrong data arrives too the database . 

Please do  NPM i  and npm run build 
too run seed : 
 npx tsc
 then run : 
node dist/seed/seed.js
